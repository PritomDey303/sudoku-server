ðŸ§© Sudoku Server â€“ Digit Recognition & Solver API
The Sudoku Server is a Python-based FastAPI backend that uses a trained CNN model to recognize handwritten or printed Sudoku puzzles from images. It extracts the Sudoku grid, detects digits using computer vision techniques, and returns a 2D array representing the puzzle.

ðŸ”§ Features
Upload an image of a Sudoku puzzle and receive a digit matrix

Pretrained CNN model (trained on MNIST) for digit classification

Grid extraction and warping using OpenCV

Optional preview endpoint to view preprocessing steps

JSON output for easy frontend integration

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
FastAPI â€“ for building the REST API

TensorFlow/Keras â€“ for digit recognition model

OpenCV â€“ for image preprocessing and grid extraction

Uvicorn â€“ ASGI server for local deployment
